# Corpus gap-spec acceptance suites

Executable definitions-of-done for the parity epics.
The two gap archetypes (`corpus/archetypes/tflike/`, `corpus/archetypes/jjlike/`)
were written ahead of the capability, so their suites here are authored red and turn
green as the owning epic lands.

The archetypes also sit in the roster proper: each carries the roster's three files
(`spec.md`, `manifest.toml`, `acceptance.toml` — see `corpus/README.md`) for the
runner, with each case `expected = "fail"` until its milestone group closes. The
suites *here* are the byte-precise form of the same criteria — per-line NDJSON
parseability, exact byte offsets, state-file rewrites — and the form that runs under
plain `pixi run test`.

**Gating note.** An epic cannot close while its suite is red; `gaps.toml` records
each gate's owning epic and status:

- `tests/tflike_diagnostic.rs` — machine contract,
  `docs/spec/implemented/parity-machine-contract.md`.
- `tests/tflike_progress.rs` — typed incremental results,
  `docs/spec/implemented/typed-command-output.md` (closed by TERM01).
- `tests/jjlike.rs` — runtime templates, whose epic code is human-assigned and not
  yet minted (see the ownership note in `corpus/archetypes/jjlike/spec.md`).

## Expected-fail semantics

Each assertion runs through `corpus_gap_suites::expect_gap`, which distinguishes
"gap not yet closed" from "suite broken":

- **No binary produced yet** (the archetype's `CORPUS_*_BIN` env var is unset, or points
  at nothing): the assertion reports **expected-fail** with its gate and reason, and the
  test passes — `pixi run test` runs the suites green, as expected-fail, not as errors.
- **Binary present, assertion fails**: still **expected-fail** — the gap is open.
- **Binary present, assertion passes**: the test **fails loudly** ("unexpected pass") so
  a closed gap is promoted — remove the `expect_gap` wrapper and the assertion becomes a
  plain requirement.
- **Suite broken** (an existing binary cannot be spawned, fixture IO fails): the harness
  panics — an *error*, distinct from expected-fail, so a rotten suite never hides as
  "gap not yet closed".

## The closed-gap tripwire (`gaps.toml` + `tests/tripwire.rs`)

Without a produced binary every assertion short-circuits as expected-fail, so a
plain green CI run says nothing about whether a gap quietly closed. Two pieces keep
that silence honest, both running under `pixi run test`:

- **The ledger** (`gaps.toml`) lists every milestone group with its owning epic,
  binary env var, test file, `status`, and `armed` assertion count.
  `tests/tripwire.rs` enforces it against the suite sources: the armed count must
  match the `expect_gap` call sites exactly (a tripwire cannot be deleted or added
  without the ledger recording it), an `open` gate must still carry its wrappers,
  and a `closed` gate must carry none. Closing an epic therefore *requires* the
  promotion edit — flip the gate to `closed` and remove the wrappers in the same
  change, or CI is red either way. This is the epic-close checklist, enforced by
  test rather than memory.
- **The simulation** (`tripwire.rs::a_gap_case_that_passes_fails_loudly`) runs the
  expected-fail machinery against a binary that already has a gap's behavior — a
  silently closed gap, manufactured on purpose — and asserts the run fails loudly
  with the gate name. The loud path itself is under test, permanently.

Detection still happens where it always did: run the suites against a produced
binary and an unexpected pass fails the run. The tripwire makes sure that signal
cannot be skipped at epic close and that the net's assertion inventory cannot
erode unnoticed.

## Running against a produced binary

```bash
CORPUS_TFLIKE_BIN=/path/to/tflike CORPUS_JJLIKE_BIN=/path/to/jjlike cargo nextest run -p corpus-gap-suites
```

Every assertion is black-box — argv in, stdout/stderr/exit status out — so an idiom
change cannot invalidate it.

## The in-repo tflike fixture

`src/bin/tflike.rs` is the tflike binary the suites run against under plain
`pixi run test`: the workspace's `.cargo/config.toml` sets `CORPUS_TFLIKE_BIN` to
the fixture cargo builds beside the suites (`target/debug/tflike`), and a value
already in the environment wins, so pointing the variable at another produced
binary still works. Under a custom `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` export the variable yourself.
The harness library links nothing; the fixture is the one target in this package
built on standout.

The fixture carries exactly the capability the two tflike gates cover, both
closed. A promoted assertion resolves the binary with
`corpus_gap_suites::required_binary`, which panics — a broken suite — rather than
skipping when the variable names nothing.
